## Baccarat Game Rules

Dealing order of the game is Player, Banker, Player and Banker.

There are 8 decks of game cards used and no joker card is used in the game.

At the start of a new shoe, the dealer will draw a card from shoe and turn over. This will determine how many cards the dealer will burn, according to the Baccarat value, except a 10 or face card will result in 10 cards burned.

The cut card will be placed around the bottom of the shoe by random. When dealer draw the "cut" card, the current round will be the last round, more cards will be drawn in order to complete this last round. After the last round, cards will be shuffled.

After the last round, all cards will be shuffled and put into the shoe to start a new shoe.

Lucky Six: If Banker wins with 6 points, and if the player has betted in Lucky Six, then the payout would be 12:1 or 20:1.

## Gameplay

Cards are given point values as follows: Ace = 1, 2-9 = face value, 10, J, Q and K = 0.

The score of the hand is the right digit of the total of the cards.

For example, if the two cards were an 8 and 7, then the total would be 15 and the score would be a 5. The scores will always range from 0 to 9. The suit is not considered.

By comparing Player hand’s point to Banker hand’s point, larger one is the winner.

For example: P(A,3,5) = 9 points win B(J,2,A) = 3 points. The hand closest to 9 wins.

If you bet on the Player and the Player wins, you are paid 1 for 1 winning on your bet.

If you bet on the Banker and the Banker wins, you are paid 1 for 1 minus 5% commission.

If you bet on Tie and result is Player or Banker win, you lose your bet.

If both the Player’s hand and the Banker’s hand have equal totals, the game result is a Tie.

If you bet on Player or Banker and the result is a Tie, all bet will be returned.

If you bet on Tie and result is Tie, your payoff is 8 to 1.

If either the Player or the Banker has a total of 8 or 9 on the first two cards no further cards are drawn. The resulting hand is called a natural and the hand is over. If both hands have the same value, it’s a Tie. Pair indicates whether Player or Banker’s first two cards are the same.

## Third Card Rules

If the Player’s total is less than or equal to 5 the Player’s hand draws a third card.

|            Player            |                   |
| :--------------------------: | ----------------- |
| Total point of starting hand | Third card rules  |
|       0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5       | Draw a third card |
|             6, 7             | Stand             |
|             8, 9             | Natural winner    |

If the Player does not draw a third card, then the Banker’s hand stands on 6 or more and takes a third card on a total of 5 or less.

If the Player does take a third card then the Banker’s third-card-rules below will determine if the Banker takes a third card.

|            Banker            |                                                            |

|              4               | If Player drew a 0, 1, 8, 9, the Banker stands             |

|             8, 9             | Natural winner                                             |
